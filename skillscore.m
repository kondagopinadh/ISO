% Skill Score is a form of model Accuracy (Error Analysis).
%
% The skill score is a statistic similar to the Nash-Sutcliffe in that the
% closer to one the better the model prediction. 
% This function interprets model predictability using residual error
% and observed variability in your data. A skill score of 1 means a perfect
% fit (don't we all wish). Skill score equal to or less than zero means
% your model error is larger than the variability in your data. 
%
% SkillScore is defined as:  1 - RMSE/SDobs
% Narrative:  One minus the Root-Mean-Square-Error divided by Standard
%               Deviation of the observed data.
%
% Dimensions of Observed data array does not have to equal simulated data.
% An intersection is used to pair up observed data to simulated. This
% function is setup to pair up the first column in the observed data matrix
% and the first column in the simulated data matrix. Data values are
% located in column 2 of both matricies. 
%
% One critical assumption to this measurement is the data are normal.
% Without "recreating the wheel" the Statistical Toolbox would be needed to
% quickly evaluate your observed AND simulated data to test for normalcy.
% For example: qqplot
%
% Another possible application for this function is using this equation for
% Genetic algorithms and optimatizations.
%
% Syntax:
%     [SKout metric_id] = skillscore(obsDATA, simDATA)

% where:
%     obsData = N x 2
%     simData = N x 2
%
%     obsData(:,1) = time observed
%     obsData(:,2) = Observed Data
%     simData(:,1) = time simulated
%     simData(:,2) = Simulated data
